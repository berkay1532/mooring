# Testnet deployment (D1)

Network: Stellar testnet (`Test SDF Network ; September 2015`). Testnet resets quarterly; re-run `scripts/testnet/deploy.sh` after a reset.

The funder account needs testnet USDC before `scripts/testnet/fund.sh` can run
(from the Circle faucet at https://faucet.circle.com — Stellar testnet, manual
step, requires a captcha). Once funded, `scripts/testnet/fund.sh` transfers
USDC from the funder into the card and prints its balance.

## Notes on this deployment

- `contracts/factory/Cargo.toml` enables the soroban-sdk
  `experimental_spec_shaking_v2` feature. Without it, the factory's own
  contract spec doesn't carry a definition for the `card::Policy` type it
  imports via `contractimport!` (a "wasm import"), and the `stellar` CLI
  cannot build its implicit CLI for *any* function on the factory —
  including `__constructor`, which doesn't touch `Policy` at all — failing
  with `error: Missing Entry Policy`. The feature requires building via
  `stellar contract build` rather than plain `cargo build` for the factory
  package; `scripts/testnet/deploy.sh` does this.
- `stellar contract invoke` on CLI 26.1.0 requires `--source-account` even
  for read-only calls (no anonymous/view-only invocation).
